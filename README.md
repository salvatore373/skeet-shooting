# Skeet shooting
This is a skeet shooting game in a retro-pixel style. Take aim, shoot and hit the skeets to score as many points as possible. You can win medals and make the new Olympic and World records. (Save your score to compete with the other players in the global chart.)

This project was created for the Kaboom.js challenge launched on Repl.it by 1729.com. The game is completely developed using Kaboom.js (ver. 0.6.0) and is designed in the platformâ€™s typical retro-pixel style.
I tried to create something new, different from the classical retro games, but still strongly inspired by them, developing a sports game that replicates skeet shooting. This is a compound of old features, like the pixel game components and the 8-bit sound effects, and new features, like the use of mouse (not predominant in the classical 80s game).
"Skeet shooting" fully exploits all the functionalities offered by the Kaboom platform to amuse and entice the player, also proposing new goals (medals and records) as they score points.
The goal of all of those features and of the attention to details is to give the player a wonderful game experience.
